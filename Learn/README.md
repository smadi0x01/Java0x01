## Getting Started

Hello this is smadi, I'll be happy to help you with object oriented programming in java.
I decided to try a new study technique called teach to learn, which means that I'll be teaching you the basics of object oriented programming in java and I'll be learning it at the same time.
```
Note: I won't be explaining the basics of programming, I'll be explaining the basics of object oriented programming in java, I believe you got the basics of programming from the previous course which was C programming.
```

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
