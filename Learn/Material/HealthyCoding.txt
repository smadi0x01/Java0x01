# In a java project we use common traditions and naming conventions. For example, we use the following naming conventions for packages, classes, and methods:

1 - Package names are all lowercase, with consecutive words simply concatenated together (no underscores). For example, com.example.deepspace, not com.example.deep_space or com.example.deepSpace.
2 - Class names are written in UpperCamelCase.
3 - Method names are written in lowerCamelCase.
4 - Constants are ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES.
